# Install Essential System Binaries

This document explains how to use the `install-essentials.sh` script to install essential command-line tools and utilities on a newly created system. The script supports both Ubuntu/Debian and macOS systems.

## install-essentials.sh

The script organizes packages into logical categories. You can specify which categories to install as command-line arguments.

## Available Categories

- [base](#Ô∏è-base-system-install_base) - Base system utilities (**always recommended**)
- [monitoring](#-monitoring--performance-install_monitoring) - Monitoring & performance tools
- [networking](#-networking--diagnostics-install_networking) - Networking & diagnostics tools
- [compression](#-compression--archiving-install_compression) - Compression & archiving tools
- [development](#Ô∏è-development-tools-install_development) - Development tools
- [file-utils](#-file--search-utilities-install_file_utils) - File & search utilities
- [productivity](#-cli-productivity--ux-install_productivity) - CLI productivity & UX tools

## Platform Notes

- **Linux**: Packages are installed via `apt-get` (Ubuntu/Debian)
- **macOS**: Packages are installed via `brew` (Homebrew required)
- Some tools may have different package names or may not be available on certain platforms (marked with *)
- The script automatically handles platform-specific package names and availability

## Recommended Usage for New Systems

1. **Minimal Setup**: Run with defaults (base packages only)
2. **Developer Setup**: Add `INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT=yes INSTALL_FILE_UTILS=yes`
3. **System Admin Setup**: Add `INSTALL_MONITORING=yes INSTALL_NETWORKING=yes`
4. **Complete Setup**: Enable all categories for full-featured development environment
